  A PROGRAM TO TEST IF A NUMBER IS A SELF DESCRIBING NUMBER

START
DECLARE SDN AS INTEGER
STORE 1 IN IT
DECLARE NUMBERSOFARRAY AS CHARACTER ARRAY
DECLARE TESTCASENUMBER AS CHAR 
DECLARE  LENGTHOFNUMBER AS INTEGER
DECLARE COUNTER AS INTEGER 
INITIALIZE COUNTER TO BE ZERO
ACCEPT NUMBER TO TEST
STORE IT INTO VARIABLE TESTCASENUMBER
CHECK FOR THE LENTH OF THE TESTCASENUMBER
STORE INTO LENGTHOFNUMBER
SET LOOP ON LENGTHOFNUMBER
STORE LOOP TESTCASENUMBER INTO NUMBERSOFARRAY LOOP
DISPLAY NUMBERS IN NUMBERSOFARRAY AND TESTCASENUMBER
SET A FOR LOOP L BASED ON LENGTHOFNUMBER 
SET A LOOP OF I BASED ON LENGTHOFNUMBER 
CHECK IF NUMBERSOFARRAY OF LOOP I IS EQUAL TO L
IF CONDITION IS TRUE INCREMEMNT COUNTER BY 1
CHECK IF COUNTER IS EQUAL TO NUMBERSOFARRAY OF LOOP M
IF CONDITION IS TRUE TESTCASENUMBER IS A SELF DESCRIBING NUMBER
ELSE TESTCASENUMBER IS NOT A SELF DESCRIBING NUMBER
END
