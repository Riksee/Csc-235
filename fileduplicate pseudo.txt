PROGRAM TO DELETE DUPLICATE FILE

START

declare name_of_file as character array
declare fileid as integer array
declare compare_file as integer
store 0 in it
declare least_id as integer
store 0 in it
declare stepscount, fileno and t as integer

accept numbers of steps
store it in stepscount
set a FOR loop to count from 0 to the stepscount-1
accept number of file to compare 
store it in fileno
declare j as integer 
store 0 in it
set a while loop j which is less than fileno
accept filename and id 
store it in filename of loop j and fileid of loop j
increment j by 1
store fileid with 0 to least_id
set FOR loop of j less than fileno
set FOR loop of i which is equal to j +1 and i less than fileno
compare filename of loop j amd I
store it in compare_file
check if compare_file is equal to zero and least_id is greater than fileid of loop j
store fileid of loop j into least_id
check if compare_file is not equal to zero and fileid of loop j is greater than fileid of loop i 
store fileid of loop j to t 
store fileid of loop i to fileid of loop j 
store t to fileid of loop i 
set FOR loop from zero to fileno-1
check if compare_file is not equal to zero 
display fileid of loop j 
check if compare_file is equal to zero 
display the filename and id that won't be deleted
