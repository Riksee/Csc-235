START
Open and read the file 'Terrorist.text' line by line and save it to a variable "input_length"
Save the first line of the text file to a variable input_sum to show the the total number of cases
Create a multidimensional array "input_feature" to hold the array of each terrorist cases
Create a variable "feature_total" to hold the sum of each terrorist cases
Create a variable "similarity_id" to hold the id of the feature similar to the current feature

Loop through "input_length" and split each element with ','
find the sum of elements in "input_feature" array and append it to "feature_total" array

Loop through each element in "feature_total" and compare to other elements in "feature_total",
If they have the same features,
set the "similarity_id" for the current feature to the index of the similar feature.

similarity_id will have stores the id of features similar to each other.
display the "similarity_id" array.
